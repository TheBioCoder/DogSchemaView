# DogSchemaView
This is a program for detailed analysis of dog genetics based of breed using data from Embark or a similar source.

This project is currently in the development stages. 

The Dog_SchemaView_0.7.8 file is a standalone file, but will still require you to download the canfam 3 files for it to run. 
you may also have to change the container to point to wherever you download those files to.

The Processing and UI files are meant to run seperatley with Processing being run first and outputting the processed data as easily parsable .pkl files.
